### Source Function


The `sourceNews` function in the `NewsOnTheGo` class 
is used to retrieve the source of a news article. 
The function takes in a string and a list of 
`NewsArticle` objects. The string is split into an 
array and the second element (index 1) is parsed as 
an integer. This integer is used as an index to 
retrieve a `NewsArticle` from the list, and the 
source of the news article is then printed.

Here is the code snippet for the `sourceNews` 
function:

```java
/**
 * Enter the news article number as stored in the array, and it will return the source of the news article.
 */
static void sourceNews(String line, List<NewsArticle> list) {
    String[] split = line.split(" ");
    int index = Integer.parseInt(split[1]) + 1;
    System.out.println(list.get(index).getSource());
}
