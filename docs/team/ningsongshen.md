## Project: News On The Go

News On The Go is a desktop application for users who want to read news articles on the go. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, News On The Go can get your news faster than traditional news apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
