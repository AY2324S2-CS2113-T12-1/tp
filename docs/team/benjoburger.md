### Enhancements implemented:
- Added the ability to find news articles based on a particular day.
  - What it does: by passing in a date, the function is able to find all the articles on that day and display it 
  back to the user.
  - Justification: This feature allows user to narrow down their search to a particular day, so that they can read 
  on news they missed on a particular day or read on any interesting news that falls on the particular date.
  - Highlights: Able to accept various date formats that is input by the user which makes the application easier to use.
  Also, integration of the `save` function into the daily function so that users can save the news articles that is 
  displayed from the `daily` function into their reading list.
  - Credits: Made use of my group mates `save` function to add the news articles into the users' reading list. 
- Added citation feature to `source` function
  - Followed the APA citation format from [Purdue University](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/general_format.html)
